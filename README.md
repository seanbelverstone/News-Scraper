## New York Times Web Scraper

Created using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and styled using components from [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/).

This application scrapes news articles from the New York Times website, using Cheerio, and displays them in an easy to read format. It also has the ability to save certain articles to a 'Saved Articles' section where you can comment on each one. 

This project is a *work in progress*.

My portfolio uses the following libraries:

- React
- Reactstrap
- Axios
- Express
- Mongo
- Mongoose
- Cheerio
